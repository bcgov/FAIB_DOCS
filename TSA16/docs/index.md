# Introduction

This technical summary provides a description of the methods and results of the timber supply analysis completed for the timber supply review of the Mackenzie Timber Supply Area (TSA). The objective of the analysis is to provide an understanding of the timber supply for the Mackenzie TSA with respect to available inventory and management information about the forest land base.

The analysis is based upon data and management information as initially described in the [Mackenzie Timber Supply Area Timber Supply Review Data Package](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/16ts_dp_2020_november.pdf). The data package was originally published November 2020 with subsequent analysis summarised in the [Mackenzie TSR Public Discussion Paper](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/16ts_dp_2022_final.pdf) published July 2022.

The intended audience of this technical summary is timber supply analysis staff of Forest Analysis and Inventory Branch (FAIB) and stakeholders such as forest consultants working for forest licensees and First Nations. The information in this report is used by the FAIB analysts to inform the Chief Forester for the determination of the allowable annual cut (AAC) for a TSA under Section 8 of the Forest Act.

This document is a record that, in conjuction with the resultant dataset, enables any timber supply analyst to understand how the analysis was completed and the forest dynamics of the Mackenzie TSA. The document is not meant to be a polished or complete summary of the analysis or timber supply review. Rather, it is a working document that hightlights the analyst's interpretation of the review's major themes documented with limited descriptions of the analysis results and some of the underlying methodologies, assumptions and drivers.

The report begins with a brief description of the current condition and practice in the unit. This includes base case land base netdown, timber profile, and an assessment of current and past practice, The next major section details the results of the analysis including: the base case, base case diagnostics and harvest flow drivers, alternate harvest flows, and sensitivity analysis on model assumptions,parameters and approaches. The final sections describes some of the major themes of the timber supply review including land base definition, yield, forest health, economic operability and cumulative effects.
